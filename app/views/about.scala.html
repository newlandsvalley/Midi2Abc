       <h2>Midi2Abc version @version</h2>
       <p>Midi2Abc is a utility that attempts to translate simple midi tunes into ABC notation. Its intention is to allow you to use a midi keyboard as an input device to generate ABC scores for traditional tunes.  A tune should be monophonic, with a single melody line (without chords). The translation will only be successful if the tune is played strictly in rhythm and with a minimum of ornamentation.</p>
